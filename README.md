In this section, the image classification of electrical and non-electrical vehivles was done by using transfer learning from a pre-trained network. The pre-trained model which served as the convolutional base provided a short pathway towards image classification as it had been previously trained with a large generic dataset. The pre-trained model could be used in multiple types of image classification problems as it had been trained to have a 'worldwide' vision. Herein, the model, 'MobilNet' was used as the convolutional base for transfer learning. 

The dataset collected was diverse, in which multiple brands of EV and non-EV images were processed to minimize biasness. Brands such as Nissan, Porsche, Renault, Mitsubishi and BMW were collected in equivalent. The images of EV and non-EV took up half portion each of the total dataset. Then, the dataset was mixed. About 60% of the dataset was used as test set while the remaining portion was used as validation test set. 

To verify the result, the accuracy and loss of both test and validation test set were plotted.
